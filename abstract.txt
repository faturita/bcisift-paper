In this work, we propose a method to analyze and classify the detection of Slow Waves (SW) that are based on the extraction of descriptors of visually relevant characteristics from images of the signal plots. This procedure has the advantage that the characteristics used for classification are visually relevant and meaningful to a human observer. The characterization of these waves is essential because they play a major role in memory formation as well as in cleansing the brain of aberrant proteins, such as the precursors of Alzheimer's disease. A registered sleep technologist (RST) can identify an SW by visually observing its shape.  However, this procedure is time-consuming and the agreement rate between different experts is often very low. Considering that sleep studies are typically several hours long, manual SW detection can be very slow, and human error can occur due to examiner fatigue. For this reason, it is of great interest the automatic detection of SW, minimizing the error and the classification time.  Results on an annotated public dataset of Polysomnography (PSG) shows that the visual characterization of SW can be effectively mapped into a feature descriptor and that several classifiers used in EEG research are able to classify the signals with an accuracy similar to a visual observer.
